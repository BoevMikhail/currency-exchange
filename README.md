This is test app. This app can exchange currencies, show currency rate.
API - https://apilayer.com/marketplace/exchangerates_data-api (only 250 requests per month so why i use json file when service is unavailible).
I used useContext and session storage due to the request limit, and also converted currencies using math rather than via API.
